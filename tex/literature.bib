  abstract = {Abstract             Accurately controllable shading detail is a crucial aspect of realistic appearance modelling. Two fundamental building blocks for this are microfacet BRDFs, which describe the statistical behaviour of infinitely small facets, and normal maps, which provide user‐controllable spatio‐directional surface features. We analyse the filtering of the combined effect of a microfacet BRDF and a normal map. By partitioning the half‐vector domain into bins we show that the filtering problem can be reduced to evaluation of an integral histogram (IH), a generalization of a summed‐area table (SAT). Integral histograms are known for their large memory requirements, which are usually proportional to the number of bins. To alleviate this, we introduce Inverse Bin Maps, a specialised form of IH with a memory footprint that is practically independent of the number of bins. Based on these, we present a memory‐efficient, production‐ready approach for filtering of high resolution normal maps with arbitrary Beckmann flake roughness. In the corner case of specular normal maps (zero, or very small roughness values) our method shows similar convergence rates to the current state of the art, and is also more memory efficient.},

The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call “mip-NeRF” (`a la “mipmap”), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF’s ability to represent fine details, while also being 7\% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17\% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60\% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22× faster.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Rendering materials such as metallic paints, scratched metals and rough plastics requires glint integrators that can capture all micro‐specular highlights falling into a pixel footprint, faithfully replicating surface appearance. Specular normal maps can be used to represent a wide range of arbitrary micro‐structures. The use of normal maps comes with important drawbacks though: the appearance is dark overall due to back‐facing normals and importance sampling is suboptimal, especially when the micro‐surface is very rough. We propose a new glint integrator relying on a multiple‐scattering patch‐based BRDF addressing these issues. To do so, our method uses a modified version of microfacet‐based normal mapping [SHHD17] designed for glint rendering, leveraging symmetric microfacets. To model multiple‐scattering, we re‐introduce the lost energy caused by a perfectly specular, single‐scattering formulation instead of using expensive random walks. This reflectance model is the basis of our patch‐based BRDF, enabling robust sampling and artifact‐free rendering with a natural appearance. Additional calculation costs amount to about 40\% in the worst cases compared to previous methods [YHMR16, CCM18].},

Several methods have proposed off‐line solutions, but none is dedicated to high‐performance graphics. In this work, we propose a novel physically based BRDF for real‐time rendering of glints. Our model can reproduce the appearance of sparkling materials (rocks, rough plastics, glitter fabrics, etc.). Compared to the previous real‐time method [ZK16], which is not physically based, our BRDF uses normalized NDFs and converges to the standard microfacet BRDF [CT82] for a large number of microfacets. Our method procedurally computes NDFs with hundreds of sharp lobes. It relies on a dictionary of 1D marginal distributions: at each location two of them are randomly picked and multiplied (to obtain a NDF), rotated (to increase the variety), and scaled (to control standard deviation/roughness). The dictionary is multiscale, does not depend on roughness, and has a low memory footprint (less than 1 MiB).},

Several methods have been proposed for mono-lobe bidirectional reflection distribution functions (BRDFs), but none for multi-lobe BRDFs, e.g., a glinty BRDF. We present the first method for real-time geometric glint anti-aliasing (GGAA). It eliminates most of the inconsistent appearing and disappearing of glints on surfaces with significant curvatures during animations. The technique uses the glinty BRDF of Chermain et al. [2020] and leverages hardware GPU-filtering of textures to filter slope distributions on the fly. We also improve this glinty BRDF by adding a correlation factor of slope. This BRDF parameter allows convergence to normal distribution functions that are not aligned on the surface's axes. Above all, this parameter makes glint rendering compatible with normal map filtering using LEAN mapping. Using GGAA increases the rendering time from 0.6 \% to 4.2 \% and it requires 1/3 more memory due to MIP mapping of tabulated slope distributions. The results are compared with references using a thousand samples per pixel.},

They are typically sampled using a mono-lobe Gaussian approximation, leading to high variance and fireflies in the rendering. Our method optimally samples the multi-lobe VNDF, leading to lower variance and removing firefly artefacts at equal render time. It allows, for example, the rendering of glittering glass which requires an efficient sampling of the BSDF. The procedural VNDF of Chermain et al. is a finite mixture of tensor products of two 1D tabulated distributions. We sample the visible normals from their VNDF by first drawing discrete variables according to the mixture weights and then sampling the corresponding 1D distributions using the technique of inverse cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). We achieve these goals by tabulating and storing the CDFs, which uses twice the memory as the original work. We prove the optimality of our VNDF sampling and validate our implementation with statistical tests.},

In this article, we formulate the glinty appearance rendering process as a spatio-angular range query problem of the Normal Distribution Functions (NDFs), and introduce an efficient spatio-angular prefiltering solution to it. We start by exhaustively precomputing all possible NDFs with differently sized positional coverages. Then we compress the precomputed data using tensor rank decomposition, which enables accurate and fast angular range queries. With our spatio-angular prefiltering scheme, we are able to solve both the storage and performance issues at the same time, leading to efficient rendering of glinty appearance with both constant storage and constant performance, regardless of the range of spatio-angular queries. Finally, we demonstrate that our method easily applies to practical rendering applications that were traditionally considered difficult. For example, efficient bidirectional reflection distribution function evaluation accurate NDF importance sampling, fast global illumination between glinty objects, high-frequency preserving rendering with environment lighting, and tile-based synthesis of glinty appearance.},

Similarly to LEAN mapping, it employs two mipmapped texture maps, which store the first two moments of the displacement gradients. During rendering, the projection of this data over a pixel is used to compute a noncentered anisotropic Beckmann distribution using only simple, linear filtering operations. The distribution is then injected in a new, physically based, rough surface microfacet BRDF model, that includes masking and shadowing effects for both diffuse and specular reflection under directional, point, and environment lighting. Furthermore, our method is compatible with animation and deformation, making it extremely general and flexible. Combined with an adaptive meshing scheme, LEADR mapping provides the very first seamless and hardware-accelerated multi-resolution representation for surfaces. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, we render highly detailed production models in real time on a commodity GPU, with quality matching supersampled ground-truth images.},

Our method builds upon the insight that a hemispherical mirror reflects parallel light rays uniformly within a solid angle shaped as a spherical cap. This spherical cap has the same apex as the hemispherical mirror, and its aperture given by the angle formed by the orientation of that apex and the direction of incident light rays. Based on this insight, we sample GGX visible normals as halfway vectors between a given incident direction and directions drawn from its associated spherical cap. Our resulting implementation is even simpler than that of Heitz and leads to up to systematic speed-ups in our benchmarks.},

Recent work has made the problem more tractable, however existing methods remain prohibitively expensive when using large environmental lights and/or (correctly filtered) global illumination. We present an appearance model with explicit high-frequency micro-normal variation, and a filtering approach that scales to multi-dimensional shading integrals. By combining a novel and compact half-vector histogram scheme with a directional basis expansion, we accurately compute the integral of filtered high-frequency reflectance over large lights with angularly varying emission. Our approach is scalable, rendering images indistinguishable from ground truth at over 10× the speed of the state-of-the-art and with only 15\% the memory footprint. When filtering appearance with global illumination, we outperform the state-of-the-art by \textasciitilde 30×.},

These approximations are designed to be computationally inexpensive and much cheaper than library functions, which are exact to within machine precision and, thus, highly suitable for use in Monte Carlo simulations. The approximation errors they introduce can then be eliminated through use of the multilevel Monte Carlo method. Two approximations are presented for the Gaussian distribution: a piecewise constant on equally spaced intervals and a piecewise linear using geometrically decaying intervals. The errors of the approximations are bounded and the convergence demonstrated, and the computational savings are measured for C and C++ implementations. Implementations tailored for Intel and Arm hardware are inspected alongside hardware agnostic implementations built using OpenMP. The savings are incorporated into a nested multilevel Monte Carlo framework with the Euler-Maruyama scheme to exploit the speedups without losing accuracy, offering speed ups by a factor of 5–7. These ideas are empirically extended to the Milstein scheme and the non-central χ2 distribution for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, offering speedups of a factor of 250 or more.},

In this article, we describe an efficient and exact sampling routine for the VNDF of the GGX microfacet distribution. This routine leverages the property that GGX is the distribution of normals of a truncated ellipsoid, and sampling the GGX VNDF is equivalent to sampling the 2D projection of this truncated ellipsoid. To do that, we simplify the problem by using the linear transformation that maps the truncated ellipsoid to a hemisphere. Since linear transformations preserve the uniformity of projected areas, sampling in the hemisphere configuration and transforming the samples back to the ellipsoid configuration yields valid samples from the GGX VNDF.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates rendering glittery surfaces, ones which exhibit shifting random patterns of glints as the surface or viewer moves. It applies both to dramatically glittery surfaces that contain mirror-like flakes and also to rough surfaces that exhibit more subtle small scale glitter, without which most glossy surfaces appear too smooth in close-up. These phenomena can in principle be simulated by high-resolution normal maps, but maps with tiny features create severe aliasing problems under narrow-angle illumination. In this paper we present a stochastic model for the effects of random subpixel structures that generates glitter and spatial noise that behave correctly under different illumination conditions and viewing distances, while also being temporally coherent so that they look right in motion. The model is based on microfacet theory, but it replaces the usual continuous microfacet distribution with a discrete distribution of scattering particles on the surface. A novel stochastic hierarchy allows efficient evaluation in the presence of large numbers of random particles, without ever having to consider the particles individually. This leads to a multiscale procedural BRDF that is readily implemented in standard rendering systems, and which converges back to the smooth case in the limit.},

It represents a significant improvement of a previously described approach both with respect to speed, accuracy and versatility. In the first pass two photon maps are created by emitting packets of energy (photons) from the light sources and storing these as they hit surfaces within the scene. We use one high resolution caustics photon map to render caustics that are visualized directly and one low resolution photon map that is used during the rendering step. The scene is rendered using a distribution ray tracing algorithm optimized by using the information in the photon maps. Shadow photons are used to render shadows more efficiently and the directional information in the photon map is used to generate optimized sampling directions and to limit the recursion in the distribution ray tracer by providing an estimate of the radiance on all surfaces with the exception of specular and highly glossy surfaces.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo light transport simulations often lack robustness in scenes containing specular or near-specular materials. Widely used uni- and bidirectional sampling strategies tend to find light paths involving such materials with insufficient probability, producing unusable images that are contaminated by significant variance.             This article addresses the problem of sampling a light path connecting two given scene points via a single specular reflection or refraction, extending the range of scenes that can be robustly handled by unbiased path sampling techniques. Our technique enables efficient rendering of challenging transport phenomena caused by such paths, such as underwater caustics or caustics involving glossy metallic objects.             We derive analytic expressions that predict the total radiance due to a single reflective or refractive triangle with a microfacet BSDF and we show that this reduces to the well known Lambert boundary integral for irradiance. We subsequently show how this can be leveraged to efficiently sample connections on meshes comprised of vast numbers of triangles.             Our derivation builds on the theory of off-center microfacets and involves integrals in the space of surface slopes.             Our approach straightforwardly applies to the related problem of rendering glints with high-resolution normal maps describing specular microstructure. Our formulation alleviates problems raised by singularities in filtering integrals and enables a generalization of previous work to perfectly specular materials. We also extend previous work to the case of GGX distributions and introduce new techniques to improve accuracy and performance.},

Our work is based on non-linear independent components estimation (NICE), which we extend in numerous ways to improve performance and enable its application to integration problems. First, we introduce piecewise-polynomial coupling transforms that greatly increase the modeling power of individual coupling layers. Second, we propose to preprocess the inputs of neural networks using one-blob encoding, which stimulates localization of computation and improves inference. Third, we derive a gradient-descent-based optimization for the KL and the \$\textbackslash chi\textasciicircum 2\$ divergence for the specific application of Monte Carlo integration with unnormalized stochastic estimates of the target distribution. Our approach enables fast and accurate inference and efficient sample generation independently of the dimensionality of the integration domain. We show its benefits on generating natural images and in two applications to light-transport simulation: first, we demonstrate learning of joint path-sampling densities in the primary sample space and importance sampling of multi-dimensional path prefixes thereof. Second, we use our technique to extract conditional directional densities driven by the product of incident illumination and the BSDF in the rendering equation, and we leverage the densities for path guiding. In all applications, our approach yields on-par or higher performance than competing techniques at equal sample count.},

  abstract = {We present a real-time neural radiance caching method for path-traced global illumination. Our system is designed to handle fully dynamic scenes, and makes no assumptions about the lighting, geometry, and materials. The data-driven nature of our approach sidesteps many difficulties of caching algorithms, such as locating, interpolating, and updating cache points. Since pretraining neural networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve               generalization via adaptation               , i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead---about 2.6ms on full HD resolution---thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that fully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction at the cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-time performance on a number of challenging scenarios.},

The BRDF for a single scratch is simulated using an optimized 2D ray-tracer and compactly stored in a three-component 2D texture. In contrast to existing models, our approach takes into account all interreflections inside a scratch, including Fresnel effects. At render time, the SV-BRDF for the scratch distribution under a pixel or ray footprint is obtained by linear combination of individual scratch BRDFs. We show how to evaluate it using both importance and light sampling, in direct and global illumination settings.},

However, the extra high-resolution normal map that defines every microfacet normal may incur high storage and computation costs. We present an example-based real-time rendering method for arbitrary microstructure materials, which significantly reduces the required storage space. Our method takes a small-size normal map sample as input. We implicitly synthesize a high-resolution normal map from the normal map sample and construct MIP-mapped 4D position-normal Gaussian lobes. Based on the above MIP-mapped 4D lobes and a LUT (lookup table) data structure for the synthesized high-resolution normal map, an efficient Gaussian query method is presented to evaluate -NDFs (position-normal distribution functions) for shading. We can render complex scenes with glint and scratch surfaces in real time (30 fps) with a full high-definition resolution, and the space required for each microstructure material is decreased to 30 MB.},

Yet, even the most advanced microfacet models have difficulties faithfully recreating materials like snow, sand, brushed metal or hair that feature scale‐violating glints and speckles and defy any traditional notion of filtering and level of detail. In this work, we address an important subset of such materials, namely metal and dielectric surfaces that are covered with microscopic scratches, e.g., from polishing processes or surface wear. The appearance of such surfaces features fine‐scale spatial detail and iridescent colors caused by diffraction, and has only recently been successfully recreated. We adopt the scratch iridescence model, which is known for plausible results in offline Monte Carlo settings but unsuitable for real‐time applications where extensive illumination sampling is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce an efficient technique for incoherently integrating the contributions of individual scratches, as well as closed‐form solutions for modeling spherical and polygonal area light sources, and for the first time bring scratch iridescence within reach of real‐time applications.},

We identify a number of sources of aliasing and provide effective techniques to construct a signal that has an appropriate frequency content ready for sampling at pixels at both foreground and background ranges of the scene. This enables artists to push down the sparkle size to the order of 1 pixel and achieve a solid result free from noisy flickering or other aliasing problems, with only a few intuitive tweakable inputs to manage.},

These sparkles correspond to small, isolated, shiny particles reflecting light in a specific direction, on the surface or embedded inside the material. The particles responsible for these sparkles are usually small and discontinuous. These characteristics make it difficult to integrate them efficiently in a standard rendering pipeline, especially for indirect illumination. Existing approaches use a 4‐dimensional hierarchy, searching for light‐reflecting particles simultaneously in space and direction. The approach is accurate, but still expensive. In this paper, we show that this 4‐dimensional search can be approximated using separate 2‐dimensional steps. This approximation allows fast integration of glint contributions for large footprints, reducing the extra cost associated with glints be an order of magnitude.},

The performance problem is even worse when illumination comes from environment maps, as they require either a large sample count per pixel or pre‐filtering. Pre‐filtering is incompatible with the existing sparkle models, due to the discrete multi‐scale representation. In this paper, we present a GPU‐friendly, pre‐filtered model for real‐time simulation of sparkles and glints. Our method simulates glints under both environment maps and point light sources in real time, with an added cost of just 10~ms per frame with full high‐definition resolution. Editing material properties requires extra computations but is still real time, with an added cost of 10~ms per~frame.},

  abstract = {Rendering glinty details from specular microstructure enhances the level of realism, but previous methods require heavy storage for the high-resolution height field or normal map and associated acceleration structures. In this article, we aim at dynamically generating theoretically infinite microstructure, preventing obvious tiling artifacts, while achieving constant storage cost. Unlike traditional texture synthesis, our method supports arbitrary point and range queries, and is essentially generating the microstructure implicitly. Our method fits the widely used microfacet rendering framework with multiple importance sampling (MIS), replacing the commonly used microfacet normal distribution functions (NDFs) like ground glass distribution (GGX) by a detailed local solution, with a small amount of runtime performance overhead.},

  abstract = {An efficient ray tracing method is presented for calculating interreflections between surfaces with both diffuse and specular components. A Monte Carlo technique computes the indirect contributions to illuminance at locations chosen by the rendering process. The indirect illuminance values are averaged over surfaces and used in place of a constant "ambient" term. Illuminance calculations are made only for those areas participating in the selected view, and the results are stored so that subsequent views can reuse common values. The density of the calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant accuracy, permitting less populated portions of the scene to be computed quickly. Successive reflections use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the process and provides a natural limit to recursion. The technique can also model diffuse transmission and illumination from large area sources, such as the sky.},

  abstract = {The surface of metal, glass and plastic objects is often characterized by microscopic scratches caused by manufacturing and/or wear. A closer look onto such scratches reveals iridescent colors with a complex dependency on viewing and lighting conditions. The physics behind this phenomenon is well understood; it is caused by diffraction of the incident light by surface features on the order of the optical wavelength. Existing analytic models are able to reproduce spatially unresolved microstructure such as the iridescent appearance of compact disks and similar materials. Spatially resolved scratches, on the other hand, have proven elusive due to the highly complex wave-optical light transport simulations needed to account for their appearance. In this paper, we propose a wave-optical shading model based on non-paraxial scalar diffraction theory to render this class of effects. Our model expresses surface roughness as a collection of line segments. To shade a point on the surface, the individual diffraction patterns for contributing scratch segments are computed analytically and superimposed coherently. This provides natural transitions from localized glint-like iridescence to smooth BRDFs representing the superposition of many reflections at large viewing distances. We demonstrate that our model is capable of recreating the overall appearance as well as characteristic detail effects observed on real-world examples.},

  abstract = {Complex specular surfaces under sharp point lighting show a fascinating glinty appearance, but rendering it is an unsolved problem. Using Monte Carlo pixel sampling for this purpose is impractical: the energy is concentrated in tiny highlights that take up a minuscule fraction of the pixel. We instead compute an accurate solution using a completely different deterministic approach. Our method considers the true distribution of normals on a surface patch seen through a single pixel, which can be highly complex. We show how to evaluate this distribution efficiently, assuming a Gaussian pixel footprint and Gaussian intrinsic roughness. We also take advantage of hierarchical pruning of position-normal space to rapidly find texels that might contribute to a given normal distribution evaluation. Our results show complex, temporally varying glints from materials such as bumpy plastics, brushed and scratched metals, metallic paint and ocean waves.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The interaction between light and materials is key to physically-based realistic rendering. However, it is also complex to analyze, especially when the materials contain a large number of details and thus exhibit “glinty” visual effects. Recent methods of producing glinty appearance are expected to be important in next-generation computer graphics. We provide here a comprehensive survey on recent glinty appearance rendering. We start with a definition of glinty appearance based on microfacet theory, and then summarize research works in terms of representation and practical rendering. We have implemented typical methods using our unified platform and compare them in terms of visual effects, rendering speed, and memory consumption. Finally, we briefly discuss limitations and future research directions. We hope our analysis, implementations, and comparisons will provide insight for readers hoping to choose suitable methods for applications, or carry out research.},
